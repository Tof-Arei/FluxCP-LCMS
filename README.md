Description :
The purpose of Light CMS is to provide a simple CMS for Hercules FluxCP.
The main advantage of this addon over adding pages manually is that you don't
have to directly access the web server to add new contents. New pages are added
using a WYSIWYG editor rather than editing php/html code manually and upload modifications.
This plugin also allows the Hercules/FluxCP admins to add authors who will be able to add new
LCMS content using the addon's own permission system.

The purpose of Light CMS is NOT to be a powerful CMS the same way FluxCP's purpose
is not really to be your main website. Light CMS is a tool to provide a way to add and update
simple content to FluxCP, such as a download page, without having to do it manually.

Depending on the feedbacks, my own needs and laziness I might try to turn this addon into something
more powerful in the future.

Please also take note that I'm learning how to develop for FluxCP without documentation
while developing this plugin. There are errors, there are a lot of bad design choice and I will do my best
to fix errors and optimize my code with regular updates, but don't expect a perfect piece of software just yet.

Then again, I can't stress you enough to backup all your FluxCP file before installation and try the
addon out in a testing environment to see if everything works according to your needs and without errors
before uploading it to your production server.
